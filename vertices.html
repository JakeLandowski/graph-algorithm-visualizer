    <!-- 
        The way it works: Two.js appends a fullscreen canvas inside of
        #main div on runtime, this spans the entire window.
        I put this styling here just to make the #main div snap into
        full screen as well so you can style around it. This is just 
        for you to get started with.
    -->

    <style>
        #main
        {
            position: absolute;
            top: 0; bottom: 0; right: 0; left: 0;
            background-color: #aaa;
        }
    </style>

    <div id="main">
        fullscreen canvas ends up here
    </div>

    <!-- 
        This will be deleted, but just so you can see how the canvas
        shows up. 
    -->
    
    <script src="two.min.js"></script>
    <script>

        const two = new Two
        ({
            fullscreen: true,
            type: Two.Types.canvas
        });

        const main = document.getElementById('main');
        two.appendTo(main);
        const canvas = main.getElementsByTagName('canvas')[0];
