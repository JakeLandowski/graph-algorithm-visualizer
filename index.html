    <!-- 
        The way it works: Two.js appends a fullscreen canvas inside of
        #main div on runtime, this spans the entire window.
        I put this styling here just to make the #main div snap into
        full screen as well so you can style around it. This is just 
        for you to get started with.
    -->

    <style>
        #main
        {
            position: absolute;
            top: 0; bottom: 0; right: 0; left: 0;
            background-color: #aaa;
        }
    </style>

    <div id="main"></div>

    <script src="scripts/require.js" data-main="scripts/main"></script>
